I'm Michael van Tricht, living in The Netherlands. I started freelancing when I was a teenager back in 2008. Fast forward to 2015, I graduated as a Software Engineer, and I've been rocking it as a software engineer ever since. My current tech stack revolves around Java, React, and Kubernetes, and I love diving into new technologies.
